TreeChopper 1.0 
----------------------
{s}Chop a whole tree in one swing!{}

{g}For PocketMine-MP: **Alpha_1.3.12**{}

This plugin allows you to chop down trees, ladders, and other blocks by just breaking the bottom block with an axe.

**Commands:**
```
none needed!
```

**Config:**  
The config file is preaty simple; there is a list for block ids that can be chopped down and a list of items that can be used to chop them down with. By default wood, leaves, and ladders can be chopped down with any type of axe.

**Note:**  
This suffers from a PocketMine/MCPE bug where not all droped items can be picked up. PocketMine 1.4 shouldn't have this problem and I'm planning on updating this plugin to the new api when I get the chance.
